# Save Game Exploit

The original way to boot the Tonyhax International loader is with _a special game save file_ that is placed on a PS1 memory card that you load while playing a [specific, supported authentic PS1 game disc](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list) on your console. 

## Requirements

*   Any PS1 console (SCPH-1000-SCPH-102) or supported early PS2 console (SCPH-10000-SCPH-39004).
* A [supported authentic/'black' PS1 game disc](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list) that your console can boot normally (i.e. not an 'imported region disc').
* A soft-modded PS2 console capable of [copying files](#ps2-installation-method) from a USB flash drive or other storage to a PS1 memory card. There are [alternative methods](#ps3-memory-card-usb-adapterdexdrivecomputer-installation-method) to copy the required files to a PS1 memory card available (which requires other hardware), but the soft-modded PS2 method is what I use.
* A PS1 memory card with enough space for the special save game exploit file and for the Tonyhax International loader filed.
* A FAT32 formatted USB flash drive that your PS2 console can read (if using a soft-modded [PS2](#ps2-installation-method) for installation). Please note that not all USB flash drives seem to work with PS2 consoles (due to iffy USB 1.1 support found in some newer USB flash drives). You may need to do a bit of trial and error testing to find a USB flash drive that works.

Important Note: Because the Save Game Exploit boot method uses the `HAX` or `FF9` loader file on a PSX memory card, if you use the stock BIOS Sony memory card manager you will notice that the filenames displayed will be messed up. This is a purely visual bug in the Sony memory card manager. If you need to be able to see the correct filenames, you can remove the memory card containing the `HAX` or `FF9` loader file and then exit/restart the memory card manager. You can also use uLaunchELF or something to temporarily remove the `HAX` or `FF9` file from the affected PSX memory card to get the expected behavior. Because each save game file also has it's own icon, this is even less big of a nuisance then it sounds.

## Usage

You need to copy the _Tonyhax International Loader_ and _Save Game Exploit_ files specific to your exact exploitable PSX game disc to the PS1 memory card. Then you can load the _Save Game Exploit_ file in a specific way in-game to trigger an exploit that starts the Tonyhax International loader. The exact filenames and disc-specific instructions can be found in the [Save Game Exploit Supported Games List](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list).

## PS2 Installation Method

You can use a PS2 console to copy the save game exploit files to a PS1 memory card from a USB flash drive.

You want to **use the RAW save game exploit file for your exploitable game (in the `entrypoints` directory) and the RAW loader file (in the `loader` directory)** when using this installation method. The RAW filenames are in the [list below](#save-game-exploit-supported-games-list).

Installation:

* Copy the `Tonyhax International Loader RAW File` file and the `Save Game Exploit RAW` file to the FAT32 USB flash drive using a computer.

* Eject the USB flash drive from your computer and insert it into your PS2 console. Insert a PS1 memory card into your PS2 as well. 

* Start the uLaunchElf homebrew program on your PS2 console. Navigate to the `mass` device (this is your USB flash drive) with the `DPAD` on the controller, then select it with the `circle` button. 

* Using the `DPAD` to navigate, press the `cross` button on the controller to highlight both the `Tonyhax International Loader RAW` file and the `Save Game Exploit RAW` file that you previously copied to the USB flash drive. Press the `R1` button on the controller to make the file operations menu appear in uLaunchELF. Use the `DPAD` to move to the copy function and then press the `circle` button to select it.

* Press the `triangle` button to navigate out of the `mass` device. Use the `DPAD` and the circle button to navigate into either the `MC0` (if the PS1 memory card is in slot 1 of the PS2) or `MC1` (if the PS1 memory card is in slot 2 of the PS2) device. 

* Press the `R1` button to again make the file operations menu appear in uLaunchElF. Use the `DPAD` to navigate to the paste option and press the `circle` button to finally paste both the Tonyhax International Loader RAW File` file and the `Save Game Exploit RAW` file. Now you can press the `triangle` button to navigate out of the PS1 memory card device, and remove the memory card from the PS2 console (if you want to use it in a different console).

## PS3 Memory Card USB Adapter/DexDrive/Computer Installation Method

You can use a Dex Drive (or similar hardware which connects a PS1 memory card to your computer) in combination with a visual memory card editor (such as [OrionSoft's PS1 Memory Card Manager](http://onorisoft.free.fr/retro.htm?psx/psx.htm) or [Dex-plorer](https://archive.org/details/inter-act-dex-plorer-ver.-1.10.950)), to place the save game exploit and Tonyhax International loader files on the PS1 memory card. This method requires:

*   A DexDrive, PS3 Memory Card USB adapter, or other hardware that allows you to write and modify a PS1 memory card with a computer.
*   Software such as [OrionSoft's PS1 Memory Card Manager](http://onorisoft.free.fr/retro.htm?psx/psx.htm) (for the PS3 Memory Card USB adapter) or [Dex-plorer](https://archive.org/details/inter-act-dex-plorer-ver.-1.10.950) (for the DexDrive), or [MemcardRex](https://github.com/ShendoXT/memcardrex) (for general memory card file managment and manipulation).

You want to **use the MCS save game exploit file for your exploitable game (in the `entrypoints` directory) and the MCS loader file  (in the `loader` directory)** when using this installation method. The MCS filenames are in the list below.

## Save Game Exploit Supported Games List

_Notes:_ 

* Demo versions of games do not contain load/save game functions and are hence not exploitable.

* Some games have multiple different versions of the same regional release (Rev 0, Rev 1, etc.). Sometimes, one save game exploit file won't work on both versions and multiple different save game exploit files are required. Some specific game/version combinations also do not have a save game exploit file available yet, this is a work in progress. Please see each listing below to see if this is the case for your specific PSX game disc that is a supported title.

* If you are using a Japanese PSX, it is **highly recommended** that you power off the console, put in the Japanese PSX game disc that has a save game exploit file available, block the lid sensor, and then turn on the console to boot the game disc. This makes it faster to swap out the disc once the Tonyhax International loader starts. 

* The _Exploit Instructions_ in each game listing below explain the game specific steps to trigger the exploit which starts the Tonyhax International loader.

* The _Save Game Exploit_ file can be on a memory card inserted in slot 1 or slot 2 of your console as long as the game supports loading a save game file from slot 2, it should work. Otherwise the _Save Game Exploit_ file **must be on the memory card in slot 1 of the console.**

* The _Tonyhax International Loader_ file **must be on a memory card inserted in slot 1** of your console.
