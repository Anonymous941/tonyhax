# FreePSXBoot Exploit

The [FreePSXBoot Exploit](https://github.com/bradl-in/freepsxboot) can start the Tonyhax International loader from any PS1 console's boot menu/BIOS.

Memory card files are found in the `freepsxboot` directory in each Tonyhax International release, for **all PS1 BIOS versions**. These memory card files must be 'restored' (a.k.a. written raw) to a PSX memory card. One such way to do this is to use [Memory Card Annihilator v2.0](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=116) with a modded PS2 console and USB flash drive containing the memory card file. Please note that at this time Memory Card Annihilator v2.0 does not work on the SCPH-10000 or SCPH-18000 due to not having an expansion bay (which is not accounted for by the software). Anyways for all SCPH-30000 and newer PS2 consoles here are the steps below to flash your PS1 memory card with the Memory Card Annihilator homebrew software:

Now you can turn on your PSX console without a disc in it, and then select the `Memory Card` option in the PS1's startup menu. This will start the Tonyhax international loader after a brief delay. **Before starting any backup or import disc in the loader YOU MUST REMOVE THE FREEPSXBOOT MEMORY CARD to ensure successful booting of your backup or import disc. THIS APPLIES TO BOTH SLOT 1 AND SLOT 2 FREEPSXBOOT CARDS.**

## Requirements

*   PS2 console that can run [wLaunchELF/uLaunchELF](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/wlaunchelf.713/) and [Memory Card Annihilator v2.0](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=116). You need to soft-mod with [FreeHDBoot](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5208), [FreeDVDBoot](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot) or [FreeMCBoot](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1248) to be able to use these programs on your PS2 console.
*   Any PS1 console.
*   An authentic PS1 memory card you are willing to dedicate to the FreePSXBoot exploit.
*   A fat 32 formatted USB flash drive that your PS2 console can read (**not all USB flash drives seem to work**).

## Flashing The PS1 Memory Card Image To A PS1 Memory Card

*   SCPH-103 - BIOS-4.5-2000-05-25-A

If you have a PSX console that can have multiple different BIOS versions, you may have to try each different memory card file one by one until you figure out what BIOS version you need for your PSX console.

## Restoring the PS1 Memory Card

After the correct memory card file is copied to the USB flash drive that your PS2 can read:

*   Download the [Memory Card Annihilator v2.0](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=116) and extract it's .elf file.
*   Copy the Memory Card Annihilator v2 .elf file to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive that your PS2 console can read.
*   Insert the PSX memory card and USB flash drive with the PS2 console off. Boot your modded PS2 (FreeHDBoot or FreeMCBoot, or something like that is required) and start the uLaunchElf program.
*   Navigate to the "mass" device and launch the Memory Card Annihilator v2 .elf file you previosly copied to the USB flash drive.
*   Select your PS1 memory card in the menu and then select restore. In the file picker navigate to the memory card file you copied to the USB flash drive previously.
*   Wait for the restore to complete and press X. Remove your memory card and put it into either Slot 1 or Slot 2 of your PS1 console depending on what memory card image you use.
